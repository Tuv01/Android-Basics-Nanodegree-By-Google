# Project Specifications

## App Design

1. **The app’s structure is suitable for a music player app. A similarly structured app which focuses on audiobooks, podcasts, or other audio media is also acceptable.**
2. **The purpose of each activity is easy for a user to understand through the UI design and feature labeling.**
3. **The app contains 2 to 6 activities**

## Layout

1. **OThe app contains multiple activities, each labelled, which together make a cohesive music app.**
2. **Features in the app are clearly defined either by labelling or images. For example, a button to play music could use a universally recognized triangular "Play" symbol or could have the text label "Play".**
3. **Each activity contains button(s) which link it to other activities a user should be able to reach from that activity. For instance, a ‘Library’ activity might contain a button to move to the ‘Now Playing’ activity.**
4. **The code adheres to all of the following best practices:**

- Text sizes are defined in sp
- Lengths are defined in dp
- Padding and margin is used appropriately, such that the views are not crammed up against each other.
5. **Rotation**. The app gracefully handles displaying all the content on screen when rotated. Either by updating the layout, adding a scrollable feature or some other mechanism that adheres to Android development guidelines.
6. **Best practices**. The code adheres to all of the following best practices:
   * Text sizes are defined in sp.
   * Lengths are defined in dp.
   * Padding and margin is used appropriately, such that the views are not crammed up against each other.
